# COVID Risk Profile
# Per the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-covid19-weather-sociohealth-data,
# counties with higher percentage populations of the following tend to be more vulnerable to COVID death:
#   Without a high school diploma
#   Black American
#   Children in poverty
#   In fair or poor health 

# Surprisingly, percent over 65 and population density correlated at virtually zero with COVID death rate in the dataset.
# Obesity and smoking prevalence in US counties correlated very weakly.

# Longstanding inequality in our country must be addressed.
# We must make education, health care, and nutritious food readily accessible for all citizens.
# We need to guarantee a living wage, subsidize child-care, and well-funded schools regardless of the income of the neighborhood.
