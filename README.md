# COVID Risk Profile
# Per the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-covid19-weather-sociohealth-data,
# counties with higher percentage populations of the following tend to be more vulnerable to COVID death:
#   Without a high school diploma
#   Black American
#   Children in poverty
#   In fair or poor health 

# Areas with one or more of these risk factors occur disproportionately in the US south.

# Surprisingly, percent over 65 and population density correlated at virtually zero with COVID death rate in the dataset.
# Obesity and smoking prevalence in US counties correlated weakly.

# Longstanding inequality in our country must be addressed.
# We can start by prioritizing vaccine administration and delivery to the most vulnerable areas,
# such as in Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas,
# and by investing in public health campaigns and partnering with community leaders to increase vaccine administration.
# We have a chance now to right the wrongs of inequality by prioritizing the vulnerable and funneling more funds
# to areas where they are most needed to increase the wellbeing - and productivity - of our fellow citizens.
